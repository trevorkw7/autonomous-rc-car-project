# UCSD AVL Lab Project

Welcome to my project documentation. This project is an advanced, personal endeavor built using UCSD’s AVL lab resources. It integrates stereo vision, deep learning (YOLOv4‑tiny), and sensor fusion with ROS2 to create a robust obstacle avoidance system. Beginning as a ECE 148 class project, I am working extended the scope and design to explore algorithms in autonomous navigation.
