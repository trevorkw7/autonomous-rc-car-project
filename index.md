# Autonomous RC Car Project

Welcome to my FusionPilot: an Autonomous RC Car Project! This website serves as documnetation for my self driving car project that serves as a platform for me to design, implement, and test state-of-the-art driving algorithms using the excellent resources provided by UCSD’s AVL Lab Space and ECE 148 (taught by Jack Silberman).

**What We’ve Accomplished So Far:**
- **Hardware Integration & Custom Fabrication:**  
  Developed custom electronics mounting solutions and 3D-printed protective enclosures to integrate the Jetson Nano, OAK-D stereo camera, and supporting circuitry.
- **Simulation & Real-World Testing:**  
  Successfully completed multiple autonomous laps in simulation environments as well as on real-life tracks, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and navigation.
- **Deep Learning & Sensor Fusion:**  
  Implemented deep learning models (including YOLOv4‑tiny) and sensor fusion algorithms using ROS2, enabling robust detection and real-time decision-making.
- **Advanced Navigation Algorithms:**  
  Developed and refined algorithms for precise path following and GPS-based waypoint tracking, ensuring smooth and predictable vehicle control.

**Project Goal:**  
The ultimate aim of this project is to build a fully autonomous RC car capable of navigating complex environments safely and efficiently. By integrating advanced computer vision, deep learning, and sensor fusion techniques, this project aspires to serve as a scalable platform for further innovation in autonomous navigation.

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to UCSD’s AVL Lab for providing the space and resources that made this project possible, and to ECE 148 and Professor Jack Silberman for their invaluable guidance and support.
